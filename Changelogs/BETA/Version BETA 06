BETA 06

#DEV NOTE:
I've removed most if not all useless mods I could find to better the performance and world loading, I'm pretty sure that this patch should fix all issues with chunk loading. 
Quality > Quantity, after all. 

The pack now should run much much much smoother than it did before, I no longer face lag spikes even on higher settings than I usually run.

Hopefully more to come in the next patch, I want to make this pack as optimized as possible while not having to cut out any of the main features.
